# Context superpowers: `#` references & `@` mentions

Copilot delivers precise, grounded answers when you feed it the right context. This guide breaks down every `#` reference and `@` mention available inside GitHub Copilot Chat so you can orchestrate the perfect response.

### Quick navigation

- [1. The Add context palette](#1-the-add-context-palette)
- [2. Blueprint: understanding a repository fast](#2-blueprint-understanding-a-repository-fast)
- [3. Inspecting external context](#3-inspecting-external-context)
- [4. Pairing context with agent modes](#4-pairing-context-with-agent-modes)

## 1. The Add context palette

Click **Add context** in Copilot Chat (or run **Copilot: Add Chat Context** from the command palette) to open the palette, then stack multiple references before sending your prompt. After Copilot responds, open the **Used n references** dropdown in the chat reply to confirm exactly which files and artifacts the assistant relied on.

### `#` palette: repositories, tools, and automations

The `#` picker now bundles file references **and** Copilot agent tooling. Stack multiple entries to give Copilot precise scope plus the ability to run helper commands.

#### Core workspace references

| Command | What it provides | Ideal use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#repository` | Live view of the repository tree. | Architecture summaries, onboarding. |
| `#codebase` | Snapshot of the most relevant project files (Copilot-curated). | Rapid orientation when `#repository` feels noisy. |
| `#file` / `#folder` | Contents of a specific file or directory. | Targeted reviews, localized refactors. |
| `#branch` | Diffs between the current branch and base. | Pre-merge checks, planning rebases. |
| `#pull-request` / `#activePullRequest` | PR description, comments, and diff. | Review workflows, changelog drafting. |
| `#issue` | Issue title, body, and acceptance criteria. | Building features from backlog items. |
| `#url` | Fetches content from a public webpage or doc. | Vendor API integrations, spec-driven changes. |
| `#changes` | The working tree diff (git status). | Contextualizing uncommitted work for progress updates. |
| `#todos` | Copilot TODO list state from Edit mode. | Reporting progress or reprioritizing sub-tasks. |

> **Official note:** GitHub Copilot now auto-infers nearby symbols and variables in addition to whatever you pin via `#` references. Use explicit `#file` or `#codebase` entries when you need to force a less obvious file into scope.

#### File & content utilities

| Command | What it does | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#readFile` | Injects the contents of a file without switching editors. | Quick reviews when the file isn‚Äôt open. |
| `#readNotebookCellOutput` | Shares the output from a specific notebook cell. | Debugging data science experiments. |
| `#search` / `#textSearch` | Performs a regex or plain-text search across the repo. | Locating usages or TODOs. |
| `#searchResults` | Replays the last search results from VS Code. | Following up on a search you just ran. |
| `#listDirectory` | Displays directory contents. | Auditing generated files or build artifacts. |
| `#usages` | Shows references for a symbol. | Refactor safety checks. |

#### Inline chat variables (editor shortcuts)

These keywords expand in the prompt box without opening the context palette‚Äîperfect for quick inline follow-ups.

| Variable | What it injects | Great for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#block` | The current code block or logical region. | Asking "what does this block do?" without selecting text. |
| `#class` | The surrounding class definition. | Reviewing class responsibilities or refactoring hooks. |
| `#comment` | The active comment node. | Rewriting docstrings or TODO notes. |
| `#file` | The entire active file. | Fast alternative to adding the file via the context palette. |
| `#function` | The enclosing function or method. | Requesting optimizations or tests for a single routine. |
| `#line` | The line where your cursor sits. | Quick explanations of compiler warnings or logs. |
| `#path` | The file path relative to the workspace. | Clarifying where changes should land. |
| `#project` | Project-wide metadata surfaced by Copilot. | High-level questions about build targets or structure. |
| `#selection` | The currently highlighted text. | When you've already made a manual selection. |
| `#sym` | The symbol under your cursor. | Inspecting usages or API docs for the current symbol. |

> **Official note:** Type `#` inside the chat box to see the live list for your IDE. Availability varies by environment, so rely on the picker to confirm what's supported.

**Tip:** Mentions auto-refresh‚Äîrerun the same `@terminal` after executing a command again to pass the new output.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The [official Copilot docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/chat-in-ide#using-keywords-in-your-prompt) note that chat participants can be auto-inferred (public preview). Still, typing `@` lets you pick the exact participant‚Äîincluding any Copilot Extensions installed from the GitHub or VS Code marketplaces.

**GitHub skills via `@github`**

- Mention `@github` to tap GitHub-specific skills (repo search, web lookups, dependency insights).
- Ask `@github What skills are available?` to see the current list, or combine with chat variables: `@github #web What is the latest Node.js LTS?`

#### Slash actions layered on mentions

Many mentions expose quick actions. Type the mention, press space, then choose an action from the palette.

| Mention + action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `@terminal /explain` | Summarises the attached terminal output and proposes fixes. |
| `@terminal /fix` | Generates a script or command sequence likely to resolve the error shown. |
| `@vscode /search` | Runs a full-text search across the workspace and reports results in chat. |
| `@vscode /startDebugging` | Inspects debug configurations and suggests how to launch the right one. |
| `@workspace /explain` | Walks through each open file, pointing out key code paths and TODOs. |
| `@workspace /fix` | Suggests edits across the open files to resolve the described issue. |
| `@workspace /new` | Drafts a brand-new file consistent with project conventions. |
| `@workspace /newNotebook` | Creates a notebook scaffold with recommended cells. |
| `@workspace /setupTests` | Generates boilerplate configs and scripts to enable testing frameworks. |
| `@workspace /tests` | Finds relevant tests and recommends how to run or extend them. |
| `/list` | Shows all available mentions and slash actions‚Äîperfect refresher mid-session. |
| `/clear` | Resets the current chat context without closing the tab. |
| `/save` | Pins the current conversation so you can revisit the transcript later. |

> üß† Combine slash actions: start with `/list` to rediscover options, then pivot to `@workspace /fix` or `@terminal /explain` to execute the next step instantly.

> üìö Need the canonical list? Type `/` in chat or consult the [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/chat-in-ide#using-keywords-in-your-prompt) for the latest slash commands and participants.

## 2. Blueprint: understanding a repository fast

1. Start with `Give me a high-level overview of this repo. Call out major packages and test suites.`
2. Add `# repository` so Copilot can see the structure.
3. Follow up: `Zoom in on #src/services. Summarize responsibilities and surface any TODO comments.`
4. Keep drilling: `List key exports inside #src/services/payment and highlight risky dependencies.`

> **Need ready-made prompts?** Check the [Prompt engineering playbook](../prompts/README.md) for curated templates you can copy and adapt.

## 3. Inspecting external context

Use `# url` to ground Copilot in vendor docs:

```
Integrate Plaid Link with our React app.
Reference #url:https://plaid.com/docs/link/web/ 
Generate a checklist of steps and draft a reusable hook.
```

Or point at issues to turn specs into code:

```
Implement the error banner requested in #issue:123.
Suggest which files under #src/components need updates.
```

## 4. Pairing context with agent modes

- **Ask mode:** pile up context first, then brainstorm or spec out changes.
- **Edit mode:** keep context focused (1‚Äì2 files) so Copilot can generate clean diffs.
- **Agent mode:** bundle every artifact the agent will need‚Äîrequirements (`#issue`), code (`#folder`), validation commands (`@terminal`)‚Äîbefore you hand off the longer task.

Learn more about agent modes in [Advanced workflows](../advanced/README.md).
